0. What is graph database

- to understand graph database you need to first understand what a graph is.
- a graph is a structure made of vertices and edges both can have arbitrary number of properties
- vertices or nodes: represent an object, eg. person, place
- edges or relationships: represent relationship between vertices
- graph DB are implemented using NoSql store like Mongo DB or Azure Cosmos DB
- changes to the data model has little to no impact to the application.

1. Strenght and weakness of graph DB

- strenght and weakness fall under: perfomance, flexibility and deficiencies.

1.1 Performance

- with traditional relational DB the perfomance decreases as the number of relationships queries
increases while for graph DB the performance remains constant

1.2 Flexibility

- It is easier to add to an existing structure without affecting functionality

1.3 Deficiencies

- They are not good at handling high volumes transactions
- Not good for queries that traverse the entire database
- They provide rapid data retrieval for connected data but do not create better relationship
- There is a need for efficient data design because any performance gain from graph searches can be reduce by failing to model the relationships between nodes efficiently

2. Node or vertice

- Nodes are used to represent entities, they can also represent other domain model
- You can identity a node for your graph model by identifying the nouns in your domain.
- node can contain name-value pair of data properties
- node can be assign role or type by in order to group or categorize them

3. Relationship or Edge

- Relationship are used to connect two nodes
- relationship and nodes can be queried to find related data
- a relationship has a source node and a target node and is represented in graph mode by a line or an arrow
- you can determine relationship in your graph model by identifying actions or verbs in your domain model
