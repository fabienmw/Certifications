0. Measure the rate of data processing in Request Units

- Throughput in Azure Cosmos DB is the rate at which data is processed. 
- Throughput is measured in RUs Request Unit
- An RU is the amount of CPU, memory, disk IO required to read 1KB of data in 1 second.
- The number of RU that an operation uses depends on the following factors:
    - Volumen of data read and written
    - How data is distributed across the physical resource in Azure
    - Whether the operation is read or write
    - Number of fields in the DB that are indexed and the indexing mode.
    - Complexity of operation for queries
    - Data consitency for geographically replicated collections.

1. Maximum number of RU

- when you create an Azure Cosmos collection you specify a fixed maximum number of RU. The sum or RU that all operations consume in the collection must be less than the specified value. IF this limit is exceeded request to the DB are throttled.


2. How to operate Azure Cosmos DB efficiently

- Configure enough throughput to meet performance demands
- Minimize unused excess throughput to keep your cost down.
- constantly review metrics to maxmize the efficiency of your provisioned resources.

3. Billing based on capacity you've configured

- RUs are billed on an hourly basis whether you consume them or not
- The amount charge on your Azure Cosmos DB collection is fixed
- The amount is based on the configure RUs
