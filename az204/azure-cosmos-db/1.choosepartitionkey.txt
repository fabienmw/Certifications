Choose a partition key in Azure Cosmos DB
-----------------------------------------

0. What is a partition strategy?

- If you continue to add more data to your single server and single partition it will run out of space
- A partition strategy allows you to add more partitions to your database when you need them.
- Adding more partition to the DB when you need them is called scale out or Horizontal scaling
- A partition key defines the partition strategy, it is set when creating a container and cannot be changed.
- Selecting the right partition key is an important decision in the development process.

1. What is a partition key?

- A partition key is the value by which Azure organises your data in logical divisions
- A partition key should aim at evenly distributing operations across your database to avoid hot partition
- A hot partition is a partition that receive many more request than the others 
- The amount of RU and storage required determine the number of physical partition for the container which is managed by Azure Cosmos DB
- The size of one physical partition in Azure Cosmos DB is 20GB
- The storage space for the data associated with each partition cannot exceed 20GB
- UserID, ProductID are better choices of partition keys over current date time 

2. Best practices

- To determine the partition key for a ready heavy workload, examine the top 3-5 queries you plan to use 
- Look at the value most included in the WHERE clause as a good canditate for a partition key
- For write-heavy workloads, you'll need to understand the transactional needs of your workload, because the partition key is the scope of multi-document transactions.


3. Review: Choosing a Partition Key
For each Azure Cosmos DB container, you should specify a partition key that satisfies the following core properties:

- Have a high cardinality. This option allows data to distribute evenly across all physical partitions.
- Evenly distribute requests. Remember the total number of RU/s is evenly divided across all physical partitions.
- Evenly distribute storage. Each partition can grow up to 20 GB in size.
