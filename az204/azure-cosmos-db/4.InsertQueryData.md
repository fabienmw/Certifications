0. Introduction

- Azure cosmos DB provide the data explorer tools in Azure which allow for operations like add, modify, and running store procedures

1. What is the data explorer

- Tool included in Azure used to manage data stored in Azure Cosmos DB
- Provide a UI to view, add, modify, run store procedures

2. Explore SQL query type

3. Define stored procedures and user-defined functions

- Store procedures are the only way to guarantee ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions as they are run on the server and are considered server side programming
- UDF (user defined function) are also store on the server and are used during queries to perform logic on values or document

4. Store procedure basics

- they are written in JavaScript and stored in a container on Azure
- By performing the store procedures on the engine you improve perfomance over client side programming
- Store procedure are the only way to achieve atomic transaction in Azure cosmos DB, client side SDKs do not support transactions
- Use store procedures to perform batch operations as it reduce the need to create separate transactions

``` javascript 
function helloWorld() {
    var context = getContext();
    var response = context.getResponse();

    response.setBody("Hello, World");
} 
```

5. User defined function
