1. WHAT IS A BINDING

- A binding is a way to connect to data within your code, they provide a way to integrate with data consistently.
- You can have multiple bindings providing access to different data source
- You don't have to code specific logic to connect to data source

2. Types of bindings

- Input bindings, our function can read data from these data sources
- Output bindings, our function can write data to these data sources
- Triggers are special type of input bindings that cause a function to execute

3. Types of supported bindings

- Azure Blob Storage
- Azure service bus queues
- Azure Cosmos DB
- Azure event hub
- Http endpoints
- External tables
- External files
- Azure IoT

4. Binding properties

- Name: identifies the function parameter
- Type: defines the type of binding
- Direction: determines whether it's input or output binding
- Connection: provide the name of the app setting that contains the connection string. Bindings use connection strings stored in app settings to keep secrets out of the function code. This makes your code more configurable and secure.

5. Creating a binding

- Binding are created in the function.json file
{
    "name": "myblobstorage",
    "type" : "blob",
    "direction": "in",
    "path": "pathToBlobStorage/{filename}",
    "connection": "connectionToBlob"
}

6. Binding expression

- A binding expression is a specialized text in the function.json, function parameter or code that is evaluated when the function is executed.

7. Type of binding expression

- Trigger metadata, trigger filename, appsetting, json payload, new GUID, current date time
- Most binding expression are idenfity by curly braces { }, for environment, app settings binding expressions are wrapped in percentages, %environment_name%

8. Output binding types

- Blob Storage - You can use the blob output binding to write blobs.
- Azure Cosmos DB - The Azure Cosmos DB output binding lets you write a new document to an Azure Cosmos DB database using the SQL API.
- Event Hubs - Use the Event Hubs output binding to write events to an event stream. You must have send permission to an event hub to write events to it.
- HTTP - Use the HTTP output binding to respond to the HTTP request sender. This binding requires an HTTP trigger and allows you to customize the response associated with the trigger's request. This can also be used to connect to web hooks.
- Microsoft Graph - Microsoft Graph output bindings allow you to write to files in OneDrive, modify Excel data, and send email through Outlook.
- Mobile Apps - The Mobile Apps output binding writes a new record to a Mobile Apps table.
- Notification Hubs - You can send push notifications with Notification Hubs output bindings.
- Queue Storage - Use the Azure Queue storage output binding to write messages to a queue.
- Send Grid - Send emails using SendGrid bindings.
- Service Bus - Use Azure Service Bus output binding to send queue or topic messages.
- Table storage - Use an Azure Table storage output binding to write to a table in an Azure Storage account.
- Twilio - Send text messages with Twilio.

To create a binding as an output, you must define the direction as out. The parameters for each type of binding may vary.
