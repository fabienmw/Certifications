- Azure Core tools let you develop and run azure funtion on your local machine

1. What are Azure core tool?

- A set of command line tools you can use to develop and test Azure function on local machine

2. Purpose of Azure Core tools

- Generate files and folders needed to develop Azure function
- Run debug and test function locally
- Publish function to Azure
- Core tools version 2.x is the latest and can be installed on Windows Linux and mac OS and is recommended
- Azure portal function editor does not support working with function developed locally

3. Create function locally

`- Every function belongs to a function app
- A function app is a collection of function Publish together in the same environment
- Every function in the function app share the same set of configuration and are built for the same language runtime
- A function project is equivalent to a function app in Azure and contain the code and configuration files that define your function.

4. Create new function project

- To create a new function project use FUNC INIT from the command line
- The tow most critical files in the function project are: host.json and local.settings.json
- host.json contain the runtime configuration values, like logging option for the function. The settings in this file are use both when running locally on in Azure
- local.settings.json only contain configuration values for the function app when running locally with core tools
- local.settings.json contain local runtime settings and custom application settings

5. Create a new function 

- To create a new function within the function project run FUNC NEW from the command line

6. Running function locally

- To run the function locally use the command FUNC START within a function project
- Functions cannot be run on their own they must be hosted by the functions host

7. Publish function to Azure

- Create a function app in Azure with the same language runtime as the function project
- Run func azure functionapp publish "$FUNCTIONAPP" from the function project
